# Postmortem

    Detection: The issue was detected upon project release at 06:00 WAT.
    Detection Method: The issue came to light as users reported encountering 500 Internal Server Error responses.
    Misleading Paths: Initial strace on the root Apache process provided no useful information, leading to a subsequent attempt on the www-data process, which revealed the critical error.
    Resolution: The issue was resolved by correcting a typo in the wp-settings.php file, removing the trailing p from class-wp-locale.phpp. A Puppet manifest was created to automate fixing similar errors in the future.
